# About Create: Redstone Additions

Create: Redstone Additions is an original mod by [Slimik42](https://modrinth.com/user/Slimik42) that introduces several redstone components designed to simplify some circuits.

By default, the mod uses Rose Quartz from the [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) mod and Patina from the [Copperative](https://modrinth.com/mod/copperative) mod (Forge only!), but these mods are not dependencies.

## Additional Info
You can use JEI/REI/EMI to view recipes. Also includes a minor crafting recipe for [Copperative](https://modrinth.com/mod/copperative). But you don't need it to play the game. And it's only for Forge! You will have alternative recipes in place.

Still on BETA! New features and improvements are on the way...
